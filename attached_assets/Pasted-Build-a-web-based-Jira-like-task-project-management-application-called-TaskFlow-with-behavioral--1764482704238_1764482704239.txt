Build a web-based Jira-like task & project management application called “TaskFlow” with behavioral analytics as described below.
Use the following technology stack (don’t change it):
Frontend: React (functional components, hooks, React Router), modern UI (you may use Tailwind CSS or equivalent utility-first CSS).
Backend: Python Django (Django REST Framework for APIs).
Database: PostgreSQL.
Analytics & Data Processing: Pandas in the backend for aggregations and analysis.
Charts: Chart.js or D3.js in the frontend for graphs.
Other: JWT-based auth, RESTful APIs, Git support, ready for deployment on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku/AWS).
Follow the steps and structure exactly as given.

1. CORE CONCEPT
Build a Jira-like agile task management tool that combines:
Standard Jira features
Projects with boards (Scrum / Kanban).
Issues/tasks with types, statuses, priorities, assignees, comments, attachments.
Backlog, active sprints, and board view.
Workflow transitions (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done).
User roles & permissions.
Basic reports (burndown, task counts, etc.).
TaskFlow behavioral analytics features from the PDF
Capture user behavior: time spent on tasks, update frequency, completion patterns, drag/drop events, etc.
Analytics dashboard with charts and metrics.
Productivity insights and suggestions (e.g., focus tips, best time to work, daily summaries).

2. USER ROLES & AUTHENTICATION
Implement authentication & authorization with JWT.
Roles (from the PDF + Jira analogy)
Problem_Statement
Scrum Master (Project Admin)
Create / edit / archive projects.
Configure project settings and workflows.
Add/remove Employees to projects.
Create any task within their projects.
Assign tasks to Employees.
View project-wide analytics and reports.
Employee (Worker / Developer)
Can view only projects they belong to.
Can see tasks assigned to them + other tasks in their projects.
Can create tasks if allowed by project settings.
Can update status, description, log work/time, add comments and attachments on their assigned tasks.
Cannot change project membership or global settings.
Auth features
Signup, login, logout.
Password hashing.
Refresh tokens.
Role stored in user profile.

3. DATA MODEL (BACKEND – DJANGO + POSTGRES)
Design Django models & migrations for at least:
User
id, name, email, password, role (Scrum Master / Employee), avatar, created_at.
Project
id, name, key (short code like JIRA), description, created_by (Scrum Master), created_at, updated_at.
Many-to-many relation with Users (project members with role per project if needed).
Workflow / Status
Predefined statuses: “Backlog”, “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Review”, “Done”.
Allow projects to customize workflow (optional).
Issue / Task
id, project, title, description (rich text), issue_type (Story, Task, Bug, Epic, Sub-task).
priority (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
status (linked to Workflow/Status).
reporter (who created).
assignee (user).
story_points or estimated_hours.
due_date, start_date.
created_at, updated_at.
labels/tags (string array or separate Tag model).
sprint (nullable).
parent_issue (for sub-tasks).
Sprint (for Scrum)
id, project, name, goal, start_date, end_date, is_active, is_completed.
Comment
id, issue, author, content, created_at.
Attachment
id, issue, file path, uploaded_by, uploaded_at.
Activity Log / History (from PDF’s requirement)
id, issue, user, action_type (status_changed, description_edited, comment_added, assigned_changed, etc.).
from_value, to_value.
timestamp.
Behavioral Tracking / Event Log
id, user, issue, project.
event_type (task_opened, task_closed_view, status_drag_drop, started_timer, stopped_timer, comment_added, etc.).
duration_seconds (for time spent viewing/working on a task).
timestamp.
optional metadata JSON field.
Reminder / Notification
id, user, issue, reminder_time, type (due_soon, overdue, daily_summary), is_sent.
Analytics Snapshot / Suggestions (Optional but preferred)
id, user, date_range, summary text, metrics JSON (e.g., tasks_completed, avg_time_in_status).
suggestion_type (focus_tip, scheduling_tip, workload_balance).

4. BACKEND API DESIGN (DJANGO REST FRAMEWORK)
Create RESTful endpoints (prefix /api/) for:
Auth
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/logout
POST /auth/refresh
Users & Roles
GET /users/me
PUT /users/me
GET /users (Scrum Master only in their projects).
Assign user role per project if needed.
Projects
GET /projects (only those user is member of).
POST /projects (Scrum Master).
GET /projects/{id}
PUT /projects/{id}
DELETE /projects/{id}
POST /projects/{id}/members (add/remove members).
Sprints
CRUD sprints per project.
Endpoint to start and complete a sprint, and move unfinished tasks to backlog/next sprint.
Issues / Tasks
GET /projects/{id}/issues
POST /projects/{id}/issues
GET /issues/{id}
PUT /issues/{id} (with validation based on role and status).
DELETE /issues/{id}
PATCH endpoints for status transitions and for drag/drop board actions.
Endpoint to log work/time.
Comments & Attachments
CRUD comments: /issues/{id}/comments
Upload/download attachments: /issues/{id}/attachments
Kanban / Board View API
GET /projects/{id}/board → returns columns with issues grouped by status, ordered for drag/drop.
PATCH /board/move → handle drag/drop with new column & order; log activity + behavioral event.
Backlog & Sprint Planning
GET /projects/{id}/backlog
POST /projects/{id}/backlog/add-to-sprint
Calendar View
GET /users/me/calendar → tasks with due_date or start_date within a range.
Behavioral Analytics & Dashboard APIs (from PDF)
Endpoint(s) to return:
Number of tasks created/completed per day/week.
Average time tasks stay in each status.
Time spent per issue and per project by a user.
Update frequency (how often user changes tasks).
Productivity trends (e.g., completion over time).
Endpoint(s) to return suggestions:
Times of day where user is most productive.
Overloaded users (too many in-progress tasks).
Daily summary for user with “focus tasks” for today.
Notifications / Reminders
Endpoint to schedule reminders.
Background job (or simulated cron) that checks due dates and sends reminders (email placeholder or in-app).

5. FRONTEND – PAGE & COMPONENT STRUCTURE (REACT)
Use React Router with a clean layout. Create at least these pages & main components:
Auth Pages
Login page.
Register page.
Simple protected route system.
Main Layout
Top navigation bar (app name, user menu).
Sidebar similar to Jira’s left nav with links:
Projects / Boards
Backlog
Calendar
Analytics
Settings
Project List Page
Shows all projects user has access to.
“Create Project” button for Scrum Masters.
Cards or table with project status, number of open tasks.
Project Detail Layout
Tabs or sub-navigation:
Board
Backlog
Calendar
Reports / Analytics
Settings (Scrum Master only)
Kanban Board Page (Core Jira-like Feature)
Columns: To Do, In Progress, Review, Done (configurable).
Task cards with:
Title, key (e.g., PROJ-1), priority, assignee avatar, due date, labels.
Drag & drop between columns (updates status via API).
Quick filters: “My Issues”, “Only Bugs”, “By Sprint”.
On card click → open task details drawer/modal.
Backlog & Sprint Planning Page (Scrum)
List view of issues in backlog.
Create and edit issues inline.
Create / edit sprints: name, dates, goal.
Drag tasks from backlog into a selected sprint.
“Start Sprint” button.
Issue Detail View
Appears as a modal or separate page.
Shows:
Title, key, type, priority, status.
Description (rich text).
Project, sprint.
Assignee & reporter.
Dates and story points.
Tabs/sections:
Activity Log – chronological timeline of all changes.
Comments – thread with @mentions.
Attachments – upload/view files.
Buttons to:
Change status (Jira-like status dropdown).
Log work/time.
Edit task.
Whenever the issue detail is opened/closed, record behavioral events (time spent).
Calendar View
Monthly/weekly calendar displaying tasks by due_date or start_date.
Color-code by status or priority.
Clicking an item opens the issue detail.
Filter by project, status, assignee.
Analytics Dashboard (For User & For Project)
Implement using Chart.js or D3.js with data from analytics APIs.
For individual user:
Line chart of tasks completed per day/week.
Bar chart of time spent by status (To Do vs In Progress vs Review vs Done).
Pie/donut chart of work distribution across projects.
Productivity trend: e.g., average completion time.
For Scrum Master / Project:
Burndown chart for active sprint.
Cumulative flow diagram (issues across statuses over time).
Table of users with:
Tasks assigned, in progress, completed.
Average cycle time.
Highlight potential bottlenecks (e.g., too many tasks in Review).
Suggestions / Insights Panel
On dashboard, show cards like:
“You complete most tasks between 10–12 AM. Try scheduling focused work during this time.”
“You have 5 tasks in ‘In Progress’. Consider finishing some before starting new ones.”
Use backend analytics endpoints to generate suggestion text.
User Profile Page
View/update profile details.
Show personal stats summary (“Last 7 days: X tasks completed, Y hours logged”).

6. BEHAVIORAL DATA CAPTURE (IMPORTANT)
Implement in frontend & backend:
When a user:
Opens an issue.
Keeps an issue open for some time (track time spent).
Drags a card between columns.
Completes a task.
Edits description or adds a comment.
Send appropriate events to backend:
Endpoint e.g. POST /analytics/events
Payload: user_id, issue_id, project_id, event_type, duration, timestamp, optional metadata.
Backend:
Store events in Behavioral Event model.
Use scheduled/background tasks or on-demand queries with Pandas to compute aggregated metrics and suggestions.
This behavioral analytics and optimization layer is mandatory and should follow the PDF description.

7. WORKFLOW & JIRA-LIKE BEHAVIOR
Model Jira-like workflow and behavior:
Statuses & Transitions
Default: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done.
Validate transitions on backend (cannot jump from Backlog directly to Done unless rule allows).
Sprint Flow
Backlog issues → Added to Sprint → Active Sprint tracking → Sprint completion.
After sprint completion: generate a sprint summary and move unfinished issues back to backlog or next sprint.
Notifications
Basic notification system:
When issue is assigned to a user.
When status changes to “Review” or “Done”.
When due date is near or missed.
Implement as in-app notification list; email sending can be stubbed.

8. TESTING & DEPLOYMENT
Add unit tests and basic integration tests for:
Auth.
CRUD operations for projects, issues, sprints.
Board drag/drop update.
Behavioral event logging.
Prepare environment configuration for:
Local development using SQLite as an option, but production targeting PostgreSQL.
Environment variables for DB, secret keys, and CORS.
Provide instructions (README) for:
Backend setup (Django migrations, superuser creation).
Frontend setup (install, run dev server, build).
Running both with a common base URL (/api for backend).

9. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Code must be clean, modular, and well-commented.
Use javaScript on the frontend if possible, but plain JS is acceptable if required.
Ensure responsive UI (desktop and laptop layouts, at least).
Keep the design similar in spirit to Jira / the reference board image (left sidebar, main board, cards in columns).
Do not skip behavioral analytics or roles; they are essential.

Generate all necessary backend and frontend code, file structures, configuration, and instructions to implement this complete TaskFlow Jira-like task management and behavioral analytics platform, strictly following the step-by-step specifications above.
